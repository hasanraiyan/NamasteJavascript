 **Your Task:**
 You are an expert technical note-taker and Markdown formatter. Your job is to:

 1. **Watch and analyze the video** (provided via YouTube link or file).
 2. **Extract all critical concepts, key explanations, code snippets, and practical examples**.
 3. **Write a structured, professionally formatted `README.md` style document** that can be used for sharing or publishing.

### 📘 **Formatting Instructions:**

* Use **Markdown syntax**:

  * `#`, `##`, `###` for headers
  * `**bold**`, `*italic*`, ` blockquotes` for emphasis
  * Triple backticks (``) for **code blocks**, with language identifiers (e.g. ` ``js `, ` \`\`\`python \`)
* Structure:

  * `# Title` (with Subtitle, Author, Date)
  * `## Table of Contents` with internal anchor links
  * `## Section-wise breakdown` of all topics explained in the video
  * `## Code Snippets` clearly marked and syntax-highlighted
  * `## Pro Tips`, `## Warnings`, `## Notes` — use blockquotes and emojis for attention
  * `## Summary / Final Thoughts`

---

### 🧠 **Style Requirements:**

* Use **clear, professional formatting**
* Include emojis where useful:

  * ✅ Tips → `✅ Tip:`
  * ⚠️ Warnings → `⚠️ Warning:`
  * 💡 Notes → `💡 Note:`
* Use bullet lists and indentation for nested explanations
* All code must be clean, readable, and runnable

---

### 📤 **Output Requirements:**

* Output a **single Markdown file (`notes.md`)** — paste only its content
* Do **not** include any explanations outside the file
* File must be directly usable in GitHub README or VS Code
